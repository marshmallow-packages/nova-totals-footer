# Laravel Nova Totals footer
This [Laravel Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) package is used for calculating the total of the columns that you wish to show.

## Requirements

- `php: ^8.1`
- `laravel/nova: ^5.0`

## Installation

Install via composer:

``` php
composer require marshmallow/nova-totals-footer
```

## Usage
To include specific fields in the table footer, invoke their respective `calculate` methods. Within this method, specify the calculation logic to determine the desired value. By default, the available calculation methods include `sum`, `count`, `avg`, `min` and `max`. Refer to the example below for further clarification.

```php
Currency::make('Revenue', 'revenue')
    ->required()

    /** üëá This is where the magic happens */
    ->calculate(
        method: 'sum', // sum, count, avg, min and max
        title: 'Total',
        prefix: '$',
        postfix: '.00',
        hideTitle: true, // true, false (default)
        align: 'right', // left, right (default), center
        titleAlign: 'right', // left, right (default), center
    ),
```

### Hide the header off footer
This sound weird, but sometimes we needed to hide the header of the footer. We didn't need this extra footer row. Is you need to hide this, you can call the method below.

```php
use Marshmallow\NovaTotalsFooter\NovaTotalsFooter;

NovaTotalsFooter::hideHeader();
```
